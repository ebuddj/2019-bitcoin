## Bitcoin Value

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the first block of the chain, known as the genesis block. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ₿10,000. 

Over this time, the Bitcoin value has skyrocketed from just US$0.06 to US$7531.83. At its peak in December 2017, it traded at just below US$20,000.

This project consists of *two different visualizations* based on [the Bitcoin value over time](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-20-million-pizza-order). *First one* is a more experimental force layout visualization showing the value of Bitcoin in the amount of pizzas. *Second and default one* is a more traditional line chart visualization.
