## Bitcoin Value

This project consists of two different visualizations based on [the Bitcoin value over time](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-20-million-pizza-order). First one is a more experimental force layout visualization showing the value of Bitcoin in the amount of pizzas. Second one is a more traditional line chart visualization. 

One chooses the layout from the top left corner.

### Pizza chart

This data shows the value of Bitcoin since 2013-02-12.

### Line chart

This data shows the value of Bitcoin since Bitcoin was introduced.
